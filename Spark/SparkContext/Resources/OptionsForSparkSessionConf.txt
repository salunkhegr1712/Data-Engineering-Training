Spark Configuration Properties:

    spark.some.property:
        You can set various Spark-specific configuration properties using this method.
        For example, spark.executor.memory, spark.driver.memory, etc.

    Application Name:
        spark.app.name: Sets the name of your Spark application.

    Master URL:
        spark.master: Specifies the URL of the cluster manager. For example, "local" for running locally or "yarn" for running on a Hadoop YARN cluster.

    Number of Executors and Executor Memory:
        spark.executor.instances: Number of executors to launch.
        spark.executor.memory: Amount of memory to allocate per executor.

    Driver Memory:
        spark.driver.memory: Amount of memory to allocate for the driver.

    Executor and Driver Cores:
        spark.executor.cores: Number of cores to allocate per executor.
        spark.driver.cores: Number of cores to allocate for the driver.

    Logging Level:
        spark.logConf: If set to true, Spark will log the configuration settings.

    Serialization:
        spark.serializer: Specifies the serializer for RDD serialization. For example, "org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer".

    Checkpoint Directory:
        spark.checkpoint.dir: Directory to store Spark's checkpoint files.

    Dynamic Allocation:
        spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled: Enables or disables dynamic allocation of executors.

    Shuffle Configuration:
        spark.shuffle.service.enabled: Enables or disables the external shuffle service.

    SQL Configuration:
        spark.sql.shuffle.partitions: Number of partitions to use when shuffling data for Spark SQL operations.

    Hive Configuration:
        spark.sql.catalogImplementation: Configures the catalog implementation for Spark SQL (e.g., "hive").

    Event Log:
        spark.eventLog.enabled: Enables or disables Spark event logging.

    External Shuffle Service:
        spark.shuffle.service.enabled: Enables or disables the external shuffle service.

    Spark Streaming:
        spark.streaming.blockInterval: Interval at which data received by Spark Streaming is chunked into blocks.
